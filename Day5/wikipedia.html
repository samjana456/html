                        Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in
                        South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic
                        Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to the south,
                        east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and
                        from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile
                        plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including
                        Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest
                        city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with
                        Nepali as the official language.

                        The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent,
                        the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In
                        the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in
                        Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet.
                        The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was
                        the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the
                        ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed
                        distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the
                        unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an
                        alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never
                        colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary
                        democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005.
                        The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular
                        republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.

                        The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal
                        parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in
                        1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the
                        permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which
                        it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of
                        Bengal Initiative.

                    Main article: Name of Nepal
                    Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[c] The precise origin of
                    the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the
                    fourth century AD.[16] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may
                    contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic attempts to
                    provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and
                    insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.[17]

                    According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne, referred
                    to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by Ne, the
                    country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl.[18][19][d] According to Nepāl
                    Mahātmya,[e] Nemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati.[20] According to Buddhist
                    mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley
                    and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of the community that would settle it. As the
                    cherished of Ne, the valley would be called Nepāl.[21] According to Gopalarājvamshāvali, the
                    genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c. 1380s, Nepal is named after Nepa the cowherd, the
                    founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot,
                    at which Nepa discovered the Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon investigation, was also named Ne.[17]

                    The Ne Muni etymology was rightly dismissed by the early European visitors.[22] Norwegian indologist
                    Christian Lassen proposed that Nepāla was a compound of Nipa (foot of a mountain) and -ala (short
                    suffix for alaya meaning abode), and so Nepāla meant "abode at the foot of the mountain".[23]
                    Indologist Sylvain Levi found Lassen's theory untenable but had no theories of his own, only
                    suggesting that either Newara is a vulgarism of sanskritic Nepala, or Nepala is Sanskritisation of
                    the local ethnic;[24] his view has found some support though it does not answer the question of
                    etymology.[25][26][27][17] It has also been proposed that Nepa is a Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of
                    Ne (cattle) and Pa (keeper), reflecting the fact that early inhabitants of the valley were Gopalas
                    (cowherds) and Mahispalas (buffalo-herds).[17] Suniti Kumar Chatterji believed Nepal originated from
                    Tibeto-Burman roots – Ne, of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and pala or bal,
                    whose meaning is lost entirely.[28]

                    This painting in a Laotian temple depicts a legend surrounding the birth of Gautama Buddha c. 563 BC
                    in Lumbini, Western Nepal.
                    By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa,
                    where they had earlier evolved.[29][30][31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia
                    date to about 30,000 years ago.[32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human
                    settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[33]

                    After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
                    structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
                    Balochistan.[34] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[35][34] the first
                    urban culture in South Asia.[36] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins
                    have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[37] The earliest inhabitants of modern
                    Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley civilisation. It is
                    possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian
                    subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the
                    Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[38] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had
                    reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or
                    both.[39] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians,
                    who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the
                    valley of Kathmandu.[40]


                    In the premises of the Changu Narayan Temple, is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the first in
                    Nepal since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini (c. 250 BC).
                    By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic
                    Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[41] The Gopal Bansa was the
                    oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan
                    kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[42] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16
                    centuries by some accounts.[43] According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part
                    in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the
                    prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka
                    and his daughter, Sita.

                    Around 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal.
                    From one of these, the Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an
                    ascetic life, founded Buddhism, and came to be known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563–483
                    BC).[44] Nepal came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening
                    centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet,[45] and helped
                    preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.

                    By 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire. Emperor Ashoka
                    made a pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha's birthplace, the inscriptions on which
                    mark the starting point for properly recorded history of Nepal.[46] Ashoka also visited the
                    Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautama Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century
                    AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta Empire.[f][47]

                    In the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis, and the Licchavi dynasty
                    came into power c. 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions;
                    Nepal's history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them.[48][45] In 641, Songtsen
                    Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal.
                    Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire.[49] The
                    Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was followed by a Thakuri rule.
                    Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known of
                    this period that is often called the dark period.[50]

                    In the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at
                    its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of
                    India. By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated Baise rajyas,
                    literally 22 states as they were counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread
                    throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries; their language, later
                    renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east
                    India.[45]

                    In south-eastern Nepal, Simraungarh annexed Mithila around 1100 AD, and the unified Tirhut stood as
                    a powerful kingdom for more than 200 years,[51] even ruling over Kathmandu for a time.[52] After
                    another 300 years of Muslim rule, Tirhut came under the control of the Sens of Makawanpur.[51] In
                    the eastern hills, a confederation of Kirat principalities ruled the area between Kathmandu and
                    Bengal.


                    Patan Durbar Square, one of the three palace squares in the Kathmandu Valley, was built by the
                    Mallas in the 17th century. The Durbar Squares are a culmination of over a millennium of development
                    in Nepali art and architecture.
                    In the Kathmandu valley, the Mallas, who make several appearances in Nepalese history since ancient
                    times, had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by the middle of the 14th century. The
                    Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut but established independent reign by
                    late 14th century as Tirhut went into decline. In the late 14th century, Jayasthiti Malla introduced
                    widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which was the caste system. By dividing the
                    indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four Varna system of
                    Hinduism, he provided an influential model for the Sanskritisation and Hinduisation of the
                    indigenous non-Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout Nepal. By the middle of the
                    15th century, Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which, according to Kirkpatrick, extended from
                    Digarchi or Sigatse in Tibet to Tirhut and Gaya in India.[53] In the late 15th century, Malla
                    princes divided their kingdom in four – Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the valley and Banepa to
                    the east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and
                    architecture in central Nepal, and the building of famous Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar
                    Squares; their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late 18th century, and ultimately, the
                    unification of Nepal into a modern state.[45][54]

                    Apart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu valley in the mid 14th century,[55] Nepal remains
                    largely untouched by the Muslim invasion of India that began in the 11th century. The Mughal period
                    saw an influx of high-caste Hindus from India into Nepal. They soon intermingled with the Khas
                    people and by the 16th century, there were about 50 Rajput-ruled principalities in Nepal, including
                    the 22 (Baisi) states and, to their east in west-central Nepal, 24 Chaubisi states. There emerged a
                    view that Nepal remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time when Indian culture
                    had been influenced by centuries of Mughal, followed by British rule. Gorkha, one of the Baisi
                    states, emerged as an influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice, after it
                    codified the first Hinduism-based laws in the Nepalese hills.[45]

                    In the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at
                    its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of

                    Prithvi Narayan Shah, began the unification process of what would become the present-day country
                    of Nepal

                    During Bhimsen Thapa's premiership Nepal reached its zenith

                    Jung Bahadur Rana, who established the autocratic Rana regime in 1846 and instituted a
                    pro-British foreign policy

                    During King Mahendra's reign, Nepal experienced a period of industrial, political, and economic
                    change.
                    In the mid-18th century, Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha king, set out to put together what would
                    become present-day Nepal. He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering
                    mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the Battle of Kirtipur, he
                    managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769.[56] The Gorkha control reached its height when
                    the Kumaon and Garhwal Kingdoms in the west to Sikkim in the east came under Nepalese control. A
                    dispute with Tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet
                    prompted the Qing Emperor of China to start the Sino-Nepali War compelling the Nepali to retreat
                    to their own borders in the north.[57] The rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the East
                    India Company over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepali War
                    (1815–16). At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until
                    committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. Thus began the reputation
                    of Gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the Sugauli Treaty, under which
                    Nepal ceded recently captured lands.[58][45]

                    Factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846, a plot was
                    discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a
                    fast-rising military leader. This led to the Kot massacre; armed clashes between military
                    personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes
                    and chieftains around the country. Bir Narsingh Kunwar emerged victoriously and founded the Rana
                    dynasty, and came to be known as Jung Bahadur Rana. The king was made a titular figure, and the
                    post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British
                    and assisted them during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (and later in both World Wars). In 1860
                    some parts of the western Terai region were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture
                    because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion (known as
                    Naya Muluk, new country). In 1923, the United Kingdom and Nepal formally signed an agreement of
                    friendship that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816.[59]

                    The Hindu practice of Sati, in which a widow sacrificed herself in the funeral pyre of her
                    husband, was banned in 1919, and slavery was officially abolished in 1924.[60] Rana rule was
                    marked by tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution.[61][62]

                    In the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were
                    critical of the Rana autocracy. Following the success of Indian Independence Movement which Nepalese
                    activists had taken part in, with India's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, Nepali Congress
                    was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy. After a decade
                    of power wrangling between the king and the government, King Mahendra (ruled 1955–1972) scrapped the
                    democratic experiment in 1960, and a "partyless" Panchayat system was made to govern Nepal. The
                    political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled.[63] The Panchayat rule
                    modernised the country, introducing reforms and developing infrastructure, but curtailed liberties
                    and imposed heavy censorship. In 1990, the People's Movement forced King Birendra (ruled 1972–2001)
                    to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty democracy.[63][64]

                    In 1996, the Maoist Party started a violent bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a
                    people's republic.[63] This led to the long Nepali Civil War and more than 16,000 deaths.[65] With
                    the death of both the King and the Crown Prince in a massacre in the royal palace, King Birendra's
                    brother Gyanendra inherited the throne in 2001[63] and subsequently assumed full executive powers
                    aiming to quash the Maoist insurgency himself.[66]

                    The Maoist Party joined mainstream politics following the success of the peaceful democratic
                    revolution of 2006;[67] Nepal became a secular state,[68] and on 28 May 2008, it was declared a
                    federal republic,[67] ending its time-honoured status as the world's only Hindu kingdom.[69] After a
                    decade of instability and internal strife which saw two constituent assembly
                    elections,[70][71][72][73] the new constitution was promulgated on 20 September 2015, making Nepal a
                    federal democratic republic divided into seven provinces.[74][75]

                    Main articles: Geography of Nepal and Geology of Nepal

                    A topographic map of Nepal
                    Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120
                    mi) wide, with an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and
                    longitudes 80° and 89°E. Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the
                    Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused
                    by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[76] Simultaneously, the
                    vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate.[76] These
                    dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused
                    the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[76] The
                    rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late
                    as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In the
                    western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest
                    gorges.[77] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that
                    rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[78] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[79] Nepal
                    lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan
                    arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500 mi)-long Himalayas,[80][81][82][83][84][85] with a
                    small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the
                    northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau.[77]


                    Mount Everest, the highest peak on earth, lies on the Nepal–China border.
                    Nepal is divided into three principal physiographic belts known as Himal–Pahad–Terai.[g] Himal is
                    the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the
                    northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including 8,848.86 metres
                    (29,032 ft) height Mount Everest (Sagarmāthā in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the
                    world's "eight-thousanders" are in Nepal or on its border with Tibet: Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu,
                    Kangchenjunga, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu. Pahad is the mountain region that does not
                    generally contain snow. The mountains vary from 800 to 4,000 metres (2,600 to 13,100 ft) in
                    altitude, with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) to alpine
                    climates above 3,600 metres (11,800 ft). The Lower Himalayan Range, reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres
                    (4,900 to 9,800 ft), is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and
                    "hills" alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably
                    less above 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) and very low above 2,500 metres (8,200 ft), where snow
                    occasionally falls in winter. The southern lowland plains or Terai bordering India are part of the
                    northern rim of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Terai is the lowland region containing some hill ranges.
                    The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the Koshi, the Narayani, and the
                    Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a subtropical
                    to tropical climate. The outermost range of the foothills called Sivalik Hills or Churia Range,
                    cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres (2,300 to 3,280 ft), marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain. Broad,
                    low valleys called Inner Terai Valleys (Bhitri Tarai Upatyaka) lie north of these foothills in
                    several places.


                    Köppen climate classification for Nepall
                    The Indian plate continues to move north relative to Asia at about 50 mm (2.0 in) per year.[86] This
                    makes Nepal an earthquake-prone zone, and periodic earthquakes that have devastating consequences
                    present a significant hurdle to development.[87] Erosion of the Himalayas is a very important source
                    of sediment, which flows to the Indian Ocean.[88] Saptakoshi, in particular, carries a huge amount
                    of silt out of Nepal but sees extreme drop in Gradient in Bihar, causing severe floods and course
                    changes, and is, therefore, known as the sorrow of Bihar. Severe flooding and landslides cause
                    deaths and disease, destroy farmlands and cripple the transport infrastructure of the country,
                    during the monsoon season each year.

                    Nepal is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system.[126] Nepal has been referred as the
                    'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal' since 2015.[127] It has seven national political parties
                    recognised in the federal parliament: Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist), Nepali
                    Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra
                    Party, People's Socialist Party and Janamat Party.[128][126] Of the two major parties which both
                    officially espouse democratic socialism, CPN(UML) is considered leftist while Nepali Congress is
                    considered centrist.[129] During most of the brief periods of democratic exercise in the 1950s and
                    the 1990s, Nepali Congress held majority of seats in parliament; CPN (UML) was its competitor in the
                    1990s.[130] After the Maoists entered the political process in 2006, they emerged as the third
                    largest party.[70] In the aftermath of the 2017 elections, the first one according to the new
                    constitution, NCP, formed by the merger of CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) had become the ruling
                    party at the federal level and in six out of seven provinces.[131] After the 2022 general election,
                    the House of Representatives of 2nd Federal parliament was formed as hung parliament and a coalition
                    government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal was formed in December 2022.[132]

                    Portrait of B. P. Koirala
                    B.P. Koirala led the 1951 revolution, became the first democratically elected Prime Minister, and
                    after being deposed and imprisoned in 1961, spent the rest of his life fighting for democracy.
                    In the 1930s, a vibrant underground political movement arose in the capital, birthing Nepal Praja
                    Parishad in 1936,[63] which was dissolved seven years later, following the execution of the four
                    great martyrs. Around the same time, Nepalis involved in the Indian independence movement started
                    organizing into political parties, leading to the birth of Nepali Congress and Communist Party of
                    Nepal.[133] As communism was trying to find its footing, Nepali Congress was successful in
                    overthrowing the Rana regime in 1951 and enjoyed the overwhelming support of the electorate.[134] In
                    the partyless Panchayat system initiated in 1962 by King Mahendra, monarchy loyalists took turns
                    leading the government; political leaders remained underground, exiled or in prison.[63] A communist
                    insurgency was crushed in its cradle in the 1970s, which led to the eventual coalescence of hitherto
                    scattered communist factions under the United Left Front.
